# Simple Interview Coding Challenges.


Created 2024 by Dan Brown

------------------------------------

S.I.C.C for short, because you have to be sick in the head to think these types of coding challenges will predict success for a candidate. 
Nonetheless, here are the solutions to some of the common ones you might get during an interview coding challenge / assessment.

Most of these are in Java, one (currently) is in Python, some use Junit5 tests, some have no specific test class and just use Main() for testing purposes.

This is meant to be an educational repo for those wanting to learn how to do these types of problems, but frankly, it's also for me to basically not have to 
re-invent the wheel each time I have to do one of these "challenges". 

Having said that, do what you want with these - as this work is released with CC0 into the public domain:
